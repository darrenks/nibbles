# Nibbles Home

$Intro

### Resources

The [tutorials](tutorial_basics.html) on this site are recommended for learning the language. Also check out the Why and Philosophy pages (todo they don't exist yet) if you're more interested in the ideas behind the language.

### Where to Golf?

Good places to use Nibbles for competing online are:

-	[Anarchy Golf](http://golf.shinh.org/) (My old favorite)
-	[Code Golf Stack Exchange](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com) (Most active)

## News
- **June 29, 2021**: Nibbles is in **Alpha**! If you post code please designate it as Nibbles Alpha so as not to be confusing later when it becomes broken by language changes.

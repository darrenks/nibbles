# Nibbles Home

Nibbles is a **minimal [codegolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf)** language (it aims to be good at codegolf while remaining relatively simple). It is also purely **functional**, statically typed, and fully lazy. Syntax is **Polish** (prefix) notation. Each instruction is **half a byte**.

### Resources

The tutorials on this site are recommended for learning the language. Also check out the Why and Philosophy pages (todo they don't exist yet) if you're more interested in the ideas behind the language.

### Where to Golf?

Good places to use Nibbles for competing online are:

-	[Anarchy Golf](http://golf.shinh.org/) (My old favorite)
-	[Code Golf Stack Exchange](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com) (Most active)

# Nibbles Home

$Intro

### Resources

The [tutorials](tutorial_basics.html) on this site are recommended for learning the language. Also check out the [Why page](why.html) if you're interested in the ideas behind the language.

### Where to Golf?

Good places to use Nibbles for competing online are:

-	[Anarchy Golf](http://golf.shinh.org/) (my old favorite)
-	[Code Golf Stack Exchange](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com) (most active)

## News
- **June 29, 2021**: Nibbles is in **Alpha**! If you post code please designate it as Nibbles Alpha so as not to be confusing later when it becomes broken by language changes.

multi rets like iq (with no single alt) should mark rets optional

values_at (zip =) should be O(n) by converting to array
index of zipped also, by converting to a hashmap first

move away from md5 so that there can be a more efficient way to find salt

fix coerce tuple with : and if/else
	generally think about tuple in stuff like the set ops/etc.

combine fns to clean up ops table (scan/fold, l1)
	can have multiple reps for same thing (i.e. string has shorter rep for join)
	
want non wrapped subscript auto option

cleaner compile.hs using a template file for the main
	use ops table with BOF and EOF for implicit ops, args, and auto map?

automap could be a bit smarter
	automap only only 2nd value if using 1st and 2nd
	not totally sensical if automapping on lines, but also using ints, i.e.
		echo asdf\\n123 | nibbles "p$ "\n" p@

better checking for commutative, taking into account what the code would be if swapping order with lets

debug features to add:
	gather rest of program
	show context values
	verbose literate mode (and/or print tree) (with arg names, types, desc, indentation, debruijn names)
	see parse tree
	better op not found error message (show arg types) (hard because memoize of arg types is lazy)
	could support parenthesis that do nothing but cause error if parse isn't as expected
	could support naming vars to not need DeBruijn indices in lit

maybe (2 possible versions, one that acts like id, one that acts like Nothing)
either instead of bool/maybe?

should have dependency bounds for dlist/etc (in cabal file?).

auto input types (for command line args, essentially read show form of any type, even tuples)

"non empty list" for many [VT] for type safer haskell implementation of static analysis

infinity / handling div 0 errors/etc.

bounded integers/list size for more efficient math ops and no need for maybe on some list ops

interpreter in addition to compiler (auto build it?)

float/big decimal

memoize let rec

separate calculation of truthiness of ints for better lazy evaluation (and SmartList). i.e. max of a truthy int is truthy regardless of second arg, don't need to do the computation, but as it is, it would.

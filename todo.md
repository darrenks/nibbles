make first arg in let rec/fn be fn of () so can be a pair

debug helpers
	see current context
	show type of arg and exit
	see the parse tree

tutorial (and auto test tutorial examples)
website design

make sure handle type pair everywhere in Polylib and elsewhere (i.e. take first before operating)

coerce after foldr

10 as leading 0 in int rep

lambda and recursive functions

better op not found error message (hard because memoize of arg types is lazy)
aliases so don't have to use ~ in middle of extensions type : "1" ~
helpful error if communitive backwards (use aliases)

is white space truthiness for chars

either instead of bool/maybe
maybe id, maybe nothing
handle div 0 errors/etc
infinity

io

index/prev in loop

more extensions
	communitive extensions

auto fill $ for implicit input (or unused args that were expected to be used) (let's wait and see what would be most useful)

auto range1 map if number then multiple outputs? also could auto map if list?

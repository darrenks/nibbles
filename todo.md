accept args in any order if different type?

error if lit accidentally would map to something that is an extension
better op not found error message (hard because memoize of arg types is lazy)

is white space truthiness for chars

something to convert to truthiness

either instead of bool/maybe
maybe id, maybe nothing
handle div 0 errors/etc

pair for things like divmod, splitWhen, etc.

move coerce/etc testing to getting examples from a tutorial

infinity

io

pair in loop for macAccumL
index/prev in loop

better let

extensions

auto fill $ for implicit input (or unused args that were expected to be used)
multiple outputs

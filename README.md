## Welcome to Nibbles

Nibbles is a minimal codegolf language (which means it aims to be good at codegolf while remaining relatively simple). It is also purely functional, statically typed, and fully lazy. Syntax is Polish (prefix) notation. Each instruction is half a byte.

It is in Alpha, meaning things will be drastically changed. If you post answers please designate them as Nibbles Alpha so as not to be confusing later.

I am using GHC 8.10 (but others should work, `ruby test/testall.rb` if you want to check compatibility).

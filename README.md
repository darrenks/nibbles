Nibbles is a [code golf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf) language for mortals (it aims to be good at code golf while remaining relatively simple). It is also purely functional, statically typed, and fully lazy. Syntax is Polish (prefix) notation. Each instruction is half a byte when automatically converted from ascii to the binary form.

This is a list of ideas of things that are useless and could be remapped to something else (allowing for multi character builtins).

Only tracking things which take 2 nibbles to achieve.

available extensions
constant + constant (*) too
constant in loop
leading 0
32 char value in str
~ auto valued int (2 in *)
`0,1
`unset
length of reverse
length of map (if no filter)
length of range
length of drop/take
if of constant
value at of a range
length of a step
communitiave/associative
length / reverse of a constant string
let let (with new form of let)
~ div, or ~ mod
opcode 15, mismatched 2d+ lists

desired features
min/max
pair
list1
not
or
and
array bool
2** (or 10** if auto 2)
negativeness?
empty str
char
ord
str to int
reshape
iterate / unfold
sortby
chunk/while
splitWhen
group
transpose
base?
array split, not removing empties
==
functions
10
bitwise ^ & |
string + int coercing the otherway (old idea was to use opcode of *int str)
	if could reverse operands of + could make it +str int for good literal form
